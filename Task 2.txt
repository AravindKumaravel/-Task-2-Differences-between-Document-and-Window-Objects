						Differences between Document and Window Objects


The Document and Window objects are fundamental components of the Document Object Model (DOM) in web browsers, but they serve different purposes.


Document Object:

1) Represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.

2) Provides methods and properties to manipulate the content of the document, such as creating, modifying, or deleting elements.

3) Is part of the window object's document property, accessible through window.document or simply document.

4) Represents the structure and content of the web page, including all the HTML elements, text, and other content.




Window Object:

1) Represents the browser window itself or a tab in a browser window.

2) Serves as the global object in client-side JavaScript, meaning variables and functions declared globally are properties and methods of the window object.

3) Provides properties and methods to control the browser window, such as resizing, moving, opening new windows, or navigating to different URLs.

4) Contains properties like window.document which refers to the Document object representing the current HTML document loaded in that window.

5)Acts as the top-level object for accessing other objects and APIs in the browser environment, such as the location, history, and console.
